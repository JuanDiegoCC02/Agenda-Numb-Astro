Web Site Agenda Numb Astro

-->Description:
Numb Astro is a personal development web application focused on creating and tracking new habits through an incentive system inspired by space travel. As part of this incentive system, users receive stars on a star map, unlock stellar memories, and earn titles at each level as they progress in their habits, promoting consistency and personal growth.
Developed with React, it implements a complete CRUD system with admin tables for managing habits and users, as well as visualizing metrics through interactive charts, using ApexCharts for accessible analysis. It features a simulated backend with a JSON server and is structured in JSON format for data management. Furthermore, it integrates session validation and storage using LocalStorage /Cookies, ensuring privacy and structured control for users.
